# HANDWRITTEN-DIGIT-RECOGNITION
Handwritten digit recognition is a challenging problem in computer vision and machine learning. The goal is to accurately identify and classify handwritten digits from various sources such as scanned images, photos of handwritten digits, and digital tablets. This problem is important in numerous applications such as digit recognition in postal services, automated form processing, and signature recognition. However, accurately recognizing handwritten digits is difficult due to their different writing styles, sizes, and orientations, as well as variations in the quality of the image and noise. Therefore, there is a need for an accurate and efficient solution that can recognize handwritten digits with high accuracy despite these challenges. The MNIST  datset of handwritten digits is widespread among the data scitentists and machine leraning enthusians.The project is implemented using Convolutional Neural Networks and then for real-time prediction.
